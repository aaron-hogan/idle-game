# Test Suite Fix Progress Report

## Latest Results (02/26/2025)

All test suites are now running, and we've fixed most of the failing tests.

- **Test Suites**: 52/55 passing (95% success rate)
- **Tests**: 374/386 passing (97% success rate)
- **Remaining Failures**: 
  - `src/systems/gameLoop.test.ts`: 4 failures
  - `src/systems/__tests__/gameLoop.test.ts`: 4 failures

## Fixes Implemented:

1. Fixed GameManager.test.ts
   - Added missing setTotalPlayTime mock
   - Improved test structure to be less brittle
   - Fixed test case for update method and offline progress

2. Fixed gameLoop.ts types
   - Added null/undefined handling for tickInterval
   - Used safety checks with fallback values

3. Fixed Redux integration
   - Properly mocked dispatched actions
   - Added missing store initialization

4. Corrected resource updates
   - Ensured consistent time scales
   - Fixed time synchronization between systems

## Remaining Issues:

1. GameLoop tests (both files) still have issues with:
   - setInterval/clearInterval mocking
   - Resource updates during ticks
   - Offline progress calculation
   - Timing and state updates

## Next Steps:

1. Fix the GameLoop test files:
   - Update mocking approach for timers
   - Fix offline progress testing
   - Correct resource update expectations

## Commit History:

1. Initial fix for GameState-related test failures
2. Fixed import paths and RootState type in various test files
3. Fixed mockStore implementation for GameManager
4. Fixed gameLoop.ts tickInterval typing issues
5. Fixed GameManager test and proactive error handling

## Summary

The test suite is now 97% fixed, with only the GameLoop tests remaining. These tests have specific issues related to the timing mechanism and need to be rewritten to match the current implementation.
