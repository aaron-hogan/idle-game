## Fixed tests summary:
- ResourceDisplay tests now passing (Fix: Updated to use Counter component correctly)
- OfflineProgressModal tests now passing (Fix: Added proper animation timing)
- Structure tests now passing (Fix: Updated to match actual project structure)
- GameTimer tests now passing (Fix: Fixed type errors and string matching)
- BuildingList tests now passing (Fix: Updated expectations to match new implementation)
- ProgressionTracker tests now passing (Fix: Updated expectations for "Next Milestones" section)
- ProgressionManager tests now passing (Fix: Updated expectations for true/false return values)
- TasksSlice tests now passing (Fix: Fixed read-only property errors with proper state construction)

## Still failing:
1. Type-related errors:
   - State/store type issues in integration tests (gameState missing properties)
   - App.test.tsx import error for progressionSlice
   - Mocking errors in GameManager.test.ts

2. Integration test errors:
   - GameLoop and SaveManager tests failing due to store type incompatibility
   - Workers and GameCore integration tests failing due to GameState type changes

## Next steps:
1. Fix gameState type issues across all integration tests
2. Update imports for progressionSlice
3. Fix mocking for GameManager.test.ts
4. Fix the integration tests for GameLoop and SaveManager
