This PR fixes the YAML syntax issues in the streamlined versioning workflow.

## Problem
Previous approaches had recurring YAML syntax errors with multiline strings and shell variable handling in the workflow file, causing failures in extracting changelog entries and updating the CHANGELOG.md file.

## Solution
- Moved complex script logic into separate shell scripts created at runtime
- Used temporary files instead of problematic multiline shell variables
- Simplified the changelog extraction process to avoid YAML parsing issues
- Used heredocs with single quotes to prevent YAML interpretation problems

## Type of Change
- [x] Bug fix (fix: ...)

## Changelog Entry

### Fixed
- Resolved YAML syntax issues in the streamlined versioning workflow
