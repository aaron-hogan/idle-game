# Unnamed Idle Game: Visual Design Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the minimal visual design of "Unnamed Idle Game," our idle game project. The design approach is centered around a clean, light aesthetic with blue accent colors, focusing on readability, minimalism, and usability.

## Approach

### Design System
1. Create a cohesive minimal visual language:
   - Light color palette with blue accent colors
   - Typography using a clean sans-serif font
   - Card-based components with simple layouts
   - Consistent spacing and grid system

### Implementation Steps
1. **Update global variables and base styles**
   - Revise color variables to a light scheme with blue accents
   - Implement typography using Roboto font family
   - Update base component styles to match the minimal aesthetic

2. **Create minimal UI components**
   - Develop clean header components with proper typography
   - Implement simple layout components
   - Create minimal UI elements (buttons, cards, etc.)

3. **Apply design system to existing components**
   - Convert current UI components to use the new design variables
   - Ensure consistent styling across all game interfaces
   - Test components for readability and usability

## Resources

### Fonts
- Roboto: Clean sans-serif for all text elements

### Color Palette
- Background: #FFFFFF (White)
- Primary backgrounds: #F5F5F5, #EEEEEE (Light grays)
- Text: #212121, #616161 (Dark grays)
- Accent: #4A90E2 (Blue)

## Implementation Prompt

```
Update the visual design of our idle game to use a minimal, clean aesthetic with the following characteristics:

1. Color scheme:
   - Light background (#FFFFFF, #F5F5F5)
   - Dark text (#212121, #616161)
   - Blue accent color (#4A90E2) for important elements and interactive highlights

2. Typography:
   - All text: Roboto (sans-serif)
   - Create a clear typographic hierarchy with proper font sizes and weights

3. UI Components:
   - Cards with simple headers and subtle shadows
   - Buttons with minimal styling and clear typography
   - Create simple, clean header components for content presentation

4. Documentation:
   - Update project documentation to reflect the new visual style
   - Ensure all CSS uses CSS variables for consistency

The design should maintain minimalism with a modern, clean feel, focusing on readability and usability.
```

## Expected Results

The implementation will transform the game's visual presentation to match a clean, minimal aesthetic while maintaining good usability. All UI components will be updated to use the new design system, creating a cohesive visual experience that is modern, accessible, and visually appealing.

## Validation Criteria

- All components properly use the updated CSS variables
- Typography follows the minimal hierarchy consistently
- Color scheme maintains proper contrast for accessibility
- The visual style effectively communicates a clean, modern feel
- UI remains usable and readable at all viewport sizes
