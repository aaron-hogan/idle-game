# Tutorial and Help System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This feature will provide new players with guidance through the game's systems through contextual tooltips, modal dialogues, and interactive tutorials. The system will help players understand game mechanics and concepts while learning how to play.

## Goals
- Create a non-intrusive tutorial system that guides new players
- Provide contextual help for game features and mechanics
- Allow players to revisit tutorials if needed
- Enable disabling tutorials for experienced players

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Tutorial System
- Create tutorial system architecture
  - TutorialManager class (singleton pattern)
  - Redux slice for tutorial state
  - Basic UI components
- Implement first-time user tutorial flow
  - Welcome overlay
  - Basic controls explanation
  - Introduction to core mechanics

### Phase 2: Contextual Help
- Add help buttons to UI components
- Create contextual tooltips system
- Implement a help modal with searchable topics

### Phase 3: Advanced Tutorials
- Add milestone-specific tutorials
- Create interactive guided tutorials for complex mechanics
- Implement skip functionality for experienced players

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `TutorialManager`: Singleton managing tutorial state and flow
- `TutorialModal`: Component for displaying tutorial content
- `ContextualHelp`: Component for displaying contextual help
- `TutorialOverlay`: Component for highlighting UI elements during tutorials

### State Management
- Add `tutorialSlice` to Redux store
- Track completed tutorials
- Store user preferences for tutorials (enabled/disabled)

### Integration Points
- Hook into game initialization for first-time user experience
- Connect to milestone system for triggering contextual tutorials
- Integrate with game settings for managing tutorial visibility

## Metrics of Success
- New players complete the first set of milestones without getting stuck
- Reduced bounce rate for new users
- Positive feedback about game learning curve

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for tutorial logic
- Integration tests for tutorial flow with game systems
- User testing with people unfamiliar with the game

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 2-3 days
- Phase 3: 3-4 days
- Testing and refinement: 2-3 days
