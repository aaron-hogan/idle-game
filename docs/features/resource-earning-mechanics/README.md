## Key Features

### Resource Earning Mechanics
- **Manual clicking** for initial resource generation
- **Production rate thresholds** for milestone eligibility
- **Net-neutral** resource balance by default
- **Automation rewards** for progression

### Opposition Systems
- **Multidimensional challenges** requiring different strategies
- **Thematic representation** of anti-capitalist struggle
- **Strategic decision-making** with meaningful consequences
- **Progressive complexity** that evolves over gameplay

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Resource Mechanics**
   - Clickable resource generation
   - Production rate milestone requirements
   - Basic automation system

2. **Phase 2: Basic Opposition**
   - Implement oppression vs. resistance dimension
   - Create opposition growth mechanisms
   - Develop victory/defeat conditions

3. **Phase 3: Multiple Dimensions**
   - Add remaining opposition dimensions
   - Implement multiple counter-resources
   - Create dimensional events

4. **Phase 4: Balance and Polish**
   - Tune growth curves
   - Balance resources vs. opposition
   - Refine UI for clarity

## Design Goals

These enhanced mechanics are designed to:

1. **Increase player agency** through meaningful clicking and strategic choices
2. **Create authentic representation** of anti-capitalist organizing challenges
3. **Provide engaging progression** from individual action to collective power
4. **Offer strategic depth** beyond typical idle game mechanics
5. **Teach through gameplay** about movement building and systemic opposition

## Usage Guidelines

When implementing these designs, maintain:
- **Thematic consistency** with anti-capitalist principles
- **Accessible complexity** that unfolds gradually
- **Strategic depth** without overwhelming players
- **Meaningful choices** with visible consequences
- **Clear visual feedback** on multidimensional status
