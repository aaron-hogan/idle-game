# GitHub Actions CI Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of GitHub Actions workflows for our CI/CD pipeline, based on modern practices for React TypeScript applications. The implementation will follow our documented CI/CD pipeline requirements while incorporating industry best practices from the Comprehensive Guide.

## Goals

1. Implement automated CI checks for all PRs and pushes to main
2. Ensure code quality through linting, type checking, and testing
3. Validate build process to prevent broken deployments
4. Improve developer experience with helpful feedback
5. Establish a foundation for future CD pipeline enhancements

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Base CI Workflow

- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for main CI pipeline
- Configure to run on PR to main and direct pushes
- Set up Node.js environment with caching
- Implement basic checks:
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linting
  - Run type checking
  - Run tests
  - Build project

### 2. Add Pull Request Validation

- Create `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
- Run basic PR validation checks
- Add PR title/description validation
- Verify PR is targeting the correct branch
- Check for required documentation updates

### 3. Implement Code Quality Checks

- Create `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- Configure test coverage reporting
- Add security scanning with basic rules
- Verify CHANGELOG.md updates

### 4. Add Workflow for Dependency Management

- Create `.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`
- Implement scheduled dependency auditing
- Set up automatic security alerts
- Configure dependabot for automatic updates

### 5. Documentation and Onboarding

- Update documentation with workflow details
- Create developer guide for working with CI
- Document troubleshooting steps for common CI issues

## Security Considerations

- Store all secrets in GitHub Secrets, never in code
- Implement branch protection rules requiring CI passing
- Limit workflow permissions to minimum required
- Configure timeouts for all jobs to prevent runaway workflows

## Future Enhancements

- Automated deployment to staging environments
- Performance testing integration
- Visual regression testing
- Automated changelog generation
- Real user metrics collection and reporting

## Timeline

- Week 1: Implement base CI workflow
- Week 2: Add PR validation and code quality checks
- Week 3: Implement dependency management and complete documentation
- Week 4: Testing and refinement
