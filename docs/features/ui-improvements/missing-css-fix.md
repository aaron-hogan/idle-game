# Missing Debug Tab CSS Fix

## Issue Description
After the console spam fixes were implemented, the application encountered a build error due to a missing CSS file referenced in the EventDebugTab component. The error prevented the application from compiling and running properly.

Error message:
```
ERROR in ./src/debug/tabs/EventDebugTab.tsx 7:0-24
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './DebugTab.css' in '/Users/aaronhogan/Dev/idle-game/src/debug/tabs'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The EventDebugTab.tsx component was importing a CSS file that didn't exist in the project files:
```typescript
import './DebugTab.css'; // Missing CSS file
```

This issue was likely introduced during the console spam fix when components were refactored, but the corresponding CSS file was not created.

## Fix Implementation
1. Created the missing CSS file at the expected location:
   - `/src/debug/tabs/DebugTab.css`

2. Implemented appropriate styles for the debug tab component:
   - Basic styling for the debug tab container
   - Styling for debug sections and headings
   - Proper overflow handling for event lists
   - Consistent styling with the application's design

## Testing Verification
- Verified the application now compiles without errors
- Confirmed the debug tab displays correctly with proper styling
- Ensured no console spam is present after the fix
- Verified that the application runs properly with all debug functionality intact

## Lessons Learned
- When modifying or creating components, ensure all referenced files (CSS, assets, etc.) are properly created and committed
- Always verify that the application builds and runs correctly after making changes
- Include CSS files in the same commit as their corresponding components to maintain dependencies
