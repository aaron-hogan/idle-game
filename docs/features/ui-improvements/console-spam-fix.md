# Console Spam and Offline Progress Fix

## Issue Description

After TypeScript fixes were applied, we encountered two critical issues:

1. Excessive console logging causing performance degradation 
2. "Error processing offline progress" error appearing in the console
3. React component infinite re-rendering causing the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error

## Root Cause Analysis

The root causes were identified as:

1. **Excessive Debug Logging**: ResourceManager had multiple verbose logging statements running on every tick and resource calculation, generating hundreds of log messages per second.

2. **Offline Progress Error**: GameManager's processOfflineProgress function lacked validation for timestamps and error handling for edge cases.

3. **React Infinite Update Loop**: App.tsx had dependencies in its useEffect hook that were being updated by the same effect, creating a circular dependency loop.

## Fix Implementation

We implemented the following targeted changes:

1. **Reduced Console Logging in ResourceManager.ts**:
   - Removed high-frequency logging in updateResources
   - Added randomized sampling (only log 1-5% of operations)
   - Removed verbose logging in resource generation calculations

2. **Improved Offline Progress Handling in GameManager.ts**:
   - Added validation for lastSaveTime to prevent errors with invalid timestamps
   - Implemented a 1-hour cap on offline progress
   - Added additional error checking and handling

3. **Fixed React Infinite Loop in App.tsx**:
   - Removed problematic dependencies from useEffect hook
   - Added guard check to prevent multiple GameManager initializations
   - Used an empty dependency array to ensure it only runs once

## Testing Verification

After implementing these minimal changes, we verified:
1. The console is no longer flooded with log messages
2. The "Error processing offline progress" error no longer appears
3. The React "Maximum update depth exceeded" error is resolved

## Future Improvements

Consider adding a proper debug flag system that can globally control logging levels, rather than using hard-coded probabilities for logging.
