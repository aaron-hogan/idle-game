# Progression System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Progression System tracks player advancement through different game stages (Early, Mid, Late, End-Game) using milestones and achievements. The system provides a structured way to unlock content and features as the player progresses through the game.

## Implementation Results

The following components have been successfully implemented:

### 1. Core Data Models
- **Location**: `/src/interfaces/progression/index.ts`
- **Key Elements**:
  - GameStage enum (EARLY, MID, LATE, END_GAME)
  - MilestoneType enum for categorizing milestones
  - AchievementType enum for categorizing achievements
  - Milestone interface with requirements and unlock features
  - Achievement interface with requirements and rewards
  - ProgressionState interface for Redux state management

### 2. State Management
- **Location**: `/src/redux/progressionSlice.ts`
- **Key Elements**:
  - Redux slice with actions for adding/completing milestones
  - Actions for unlocking achievements and advancing stages
  - Selectors for accessing progression data by type, stage, etc.
  - State normalization for efficient lookups

### 3. Core Manager
- **Location**: `/src/managers/progression/ProgressionManager.ts`
- **Key Elements**:
  - Singleton pattern for global access
  - Requirement evaluation logic for completing milestones
  - Stage advancement based on completed milestones
  - Feature unlocking based on milestone completion
  - Progress calculation methods

### 4. UI Components
- **Location**: `/src/components/progression/`
- **Key Elements**:
  - ProgressionTracker.tsx - Main container component
  - StageIndicator.tsx - Shows progress between stages
  - MilestoneList.tsx - Interactive milestone display
  - AchievementDisplay.tsx - Achievement display with filtering
  - CSS styling in `/src/styles/progression.css`

### 5. Game Content
- **Location**: `/src/data/progression/`
- **Key Elements**:
  - 17 anti-capitalist themed milestones across game stages
  - Multiple achievement types with corresponding rewards
  - Initialization logic for setting up progression state

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Type Safety
- **Challenge**: Ensuring type safety across complex nested data structures
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive interfaces with strict typing

### 2. Test Integration
- **Challenge**: Integration with existing test infrastructure
- **Solution**: Created detailed manual testing guide as a stopgap

### 3. Performance
- **Challenge**: Efficient requirement checking without excessive re-computation
- **Solution**: Implemented selective evaluation and state normalization

### 4. UI Updates
- **Challenge**: Ensuring UI reflects progression state changes
- **Solution**: Used Redux selectors and effect hooks for reactive updates

## Integration Points

### 1. Resource System
- Milestone requirements tied to resource amounts
- Achievements reward players with resources

### 2. Feature Unlocking
- Completed milestones unlock features through `shouldFeatureBeUnlocked` API
- Features check this API to determine availability

### 3. Game Loop
- Progression updates checked periodically as part of the game loop
- Stage advancement impacts game mechanics

## Recent Bug Fixes (February 2025)

The following critical issues were fixed to restore progression system functionality:

### 1. Type Safety Issues
- Fixed the `Resource` interface in `/src/interfaces/Resource.ts` by replacing unsafe `[key: string]: any` with properly typed string index signature
- Corrected resource access in `ProgressionManager.ts` using strongly typed indexing
- Updated `GameState` interface to properly match actual usage in the application

### 2. UI Component Issues
- Fixed missing React hooks imports in `ProgressionTracker.tsx`
- Implemented improved throttling to prevent UI flickering
- Added proper memoization for better performance
- Re-enabled the `ProgressionTracker` component in `App.tsx`

### 3. System Integration Issues
- Re-enabled progression checking in `GameManager.ts`
- Fixed CSS test issues related to styling
- Corrected resource access patterns for safe type handling

## Test Status

The core functionality is now working correctly in the application UI, but there are remaining issues with automated tests. While runtime functionality has been restored, test infrastructure updates are still needed.

## Next Steps

1. **System Integration**:
   - Integrate with Event system for story progression
   - Connect with Opposition system (planned future feature)
   - Implement save/load functionality

2. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add animations for milestone/achievement unlocking
   - Create notification system for progression updates
   - Add tooltips and detailed help information

3. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Update test mocks to match current interfaces
   - Fix test cases for `resourceUtils` to handle the updated typing
   - Update integration tests to include progression state
   - Fix remaining TypeScript errors in the tests

4. **Feature Extensions**:
   - Implement branching progression paths
   - Create player-defined goals system
   - Add social movement growth mechanics
