# Core Game Loop Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the core game loop for our idle game. The goal is to create a basic proof of concept that demonstrates the fundamental gameplay: clicking to generate resources, reaching milestones, receiving visual feedback, and upgrading resource production to progress through increasingly difficult milestones.

## Goals
1. Implement click-to-generate resource mechanics
2. Integrate milestone progression with clear visual feedback
3. Create a resource upgrade system to increase production per click
4. Fix the progression section UI if needed
5. Provide a clear and intuitive gameplay experience

## Approach

### 1. Resource Click Mechanics
- Create a new ClickableResource component with appealing visuals
- Implement click handler in ResourceManager to add resources when clicked
- Add visual feedback for clicks (animations, particles)
- Track click power (resources gained per click) in the game state

### 2. Milestone Integration
- Utilize existing milestone system to detect when resource thresholds are reached
- Add clear visual feedback when milestones are completed
- Display current and next milestone requirements clearly
- Ensure milestone progress is always visible and understandable

### 3. Resource Upgrade System
- Create a simple upgrade UI component to increase click power
- Implement upgrade purchase logic in ResourceManager
- Scale upgrade costs with each purchase to create progression curve
- Display current click power and the benefit of upgrading

### 4. Progression UI Improvements
- Evaluate and fix the "Current Stage: Early Stage" display
- Ensure it correctly reflects the player's progression
- Add visual indicators of progress towards the next stage
- If not needed, remove or replace with more relevant information

### 5. UI and UX Enhancements
- Add visual and audio feedback for important actions
- Ensure all UI elements are intuitive and user-friendly
- Implement clear tooltips and instructions
- Create a cohesive design that guides the player through the game flow

## Implementation Steps

1. **Resource System Modifications**
   - Add click power attribute to resource state
   - Implement handleResourceClick method in ResourceManager
   - Create resource click action in resourcesSlice

2. **UI Component Creation**
   - Create ClickableResource component
   - Develop Upgrade component for resource production
   - Enhance MilestoneProgress to show clearer feedback
   - Update ProgressionTracker or remove if unused

3. **State Management**
   - Add click-related properties to the game state
   - Implement upgrade purchase and effects logic
   - Connect clicking actions to milestone progression checks

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Implement animations for resource clicks
   - Add visual effects for milestone completion
   - Create progress indicators for milestones
   - Style upgrade buttons and interfaces

5. **Testing**
   - Test resource generation by clicking
   - Verify milestone completion works correctly
   - Test upgrade system functionality
   - Ensure progression tracking is accurate

## Timeline
- Day 1: Create basic click mechanics and resource system modifications
- Day 2: Implement upgrade system and milestone integration
- Day 3: Add visual feedback and polish UI
- Day 4: Testing, bug fixing, and finalization

## Implementation Prompt
Please implement a core game loop with the following features:
1. Create a clickable area that generates the "Collective Bargaining Power" resource when clicked
2. Show milestone progress clearly and provide visual feedback when milestones are reached
3. Implement an upgrade system to increase the amount of resources gained per click
4. Display the next milestone requirements and make progression intuitive
5. Ensure the "Current Stage: Early Stage" UI is either fixed to correctly reflect progression or removed if not needed
6. Add appropriate visual feedback for resource generation and milestone completion
7. Make sure the system is expandable for future development

Integrate this functionality with the existing Resource and Milestone systems in a way that follows the game's architecture and patterns. Focus on creating an engaging click-based core game loop that gives players a sense of progression and achievement.
