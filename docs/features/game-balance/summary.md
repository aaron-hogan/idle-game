# Game Balance Configuration - Summary

## Feature Overview

The Game Balance Configuration feature provides a centralized, type-safe way to manage all game balance parameters in a single file. This makes it easy to adjust difficulty, progression, and overall game feel without modifying game logic code.

## Implementation Highlights

- Created `/src/config/gameBalance.ts` as the single source of truth for balance parameters
- Organized configuration into logical categories (ResourceGeneration, UpgradeSettings, etc.)
- Added helper functions for common calculations
- Updated resource systems to use the configuration file
- Modified game end conditions to use configurable thresholds
- Updated initial resource setup to use configuration values

## Business Value

- **Rapid Iteration**: Changes to game balance can be made in a single file without modifying game logic
- **Designer-Friendly**: Clear organization and documentation makes parameters accessible to non-programmers
- **Consistency**: Values are defined in one place, ensuring consistency across the game
- **Testability**: Configuration changes can be easily tested against different gameplay scenarios

## Technical Details

- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety for all configuration values
- Helper functions encapsulate complex calculations for readability
- Configuration is organized by functional area rather than by feature
- Default values match the previous game balance

## Future Improvements

- Add a debug UI panel to adjust balance parameters in real-time during testing
- Implement configuration profiles to test different balance scenarios quickly
- Add validation to ensure configuration values remain within acceptable ranges
- Consider moving configuration to external JSON files for non-programmer editing

## Usage Instructions

1. Locate the `gameBalance.ts` file in the `src/config` directory
2. Modify values in the appropriate section to adjust game balance
3. Run the game to test your changes
4. Iterate as needed to achieve desired gameplay feel

When making changes:
- Start with small adjustments (Â±10-20%)
- Test both early game and late game impact
- Consider player progression curve
- Ensure the game remains winnable but challenging
