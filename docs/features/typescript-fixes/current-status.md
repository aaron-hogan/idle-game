## Fixed in Latest Commit

### Test Type Errors

1. **GameManager.test.ts**
   - Fixed Redux action creator conversion to jest.Mock with type assertion
   - Used `as unknown as jest.Mock` pattern to fix conversion

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Added missing startDate property to GameState in gameCore.integration.test.tsx
   - Added missing startDate property in workers.integration.test.tsx
   - Fixed GameState type incompatibility

3. **Mock Store Types**
   - Added stub progression property in RootState mock in selectors.test.ts
   - Fixed Store<RootState> compatibility in eventManager.test.ts by:
     - Adding GameStage enum import
     - Setting correct stageReachedAt structure with early/mid/late/endGame properties
   - Added proper state shape for gameLoop.test.ts

4. **Resource and Structure Type Issues**
   - Created helper functions asResourceRecord and asStructureRecord for clean type assertions
   - Fixed multiple errors in resourceUtils.test.ts with proper type casting without changing test logic

5. **saveManager.test.ts and saveUtils.test.ts**
   - Added missing startDate property to mock GameState

6. **Mock State Structures**

   - Added tasks state structure with tasks and activeTaskId
   - Fixed initializers in both test files

## Next Steps

1. âœ… All TypeScript errors have been fixed!

2. We should now verify that the application functions correctly:
   - Run the development server (`npm start`)
   - Test core functionality
   - Ensure resource generation works correctly
   - Verify UI components display properly

3. Consider additional type system improvements:
   - Add strict mode to TypeScript configuration
   - Enforce explicit return types on functions
   - Consider adding automatic TypeScript linting on commit

4. Merge the fixes into the main branch after verification
