# Idle Game: GitHub Integration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the integration of our idle game project with GitHub for version control, collaboration, and project management. GitHub integration enables code sharing, issue tracking, and streamlined development workflows.

## Goals
- Create a GitHub repository for the idle game project
- Configure proper Git settings and .gitignore
- Push the existing codebase to GitHub
- Document the GitHub workflow for future contributors

## Approach
We'll create a new GitHub repository, set up the local Git configuration, create an appropriate .gitignore file, make an initial commit with the existing codebase, and push to the remote repository.

## Timeline
- Repository setup: 15 minutes
- Git configuration: 10 minutes
- Initial commit and push: 15 minutes
- Documentation: 20 minutes

## Future Enhancements
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Configure branch protection rules
- Create issue templates
- Establish a pull request workflow

# Idle Game: GitHub Integration Implementation

Let's implement GitHub integration for our idle game project to enable version control and collaboration:

1. Create a new GitHub repository:
   - Set up a new public repository named "idle-game"
   - Initialize with a README and appropriate license

2. Configure the local Git environment:
   - Set up Git user configuration
   - Create a comprehensive .gitignore file for Node.js/TypeScript projects
   - Configure Git to handle line endings consistently

3. Prepare the codebase for initial commit:
   - Review and clean up any temporary or build files
   - Ensure sensitive data is not included in the repository
   - Verify that .gitignore excludes appropriate files

4. Make the initial commit:
   - Add all relevant files to Git staging
   - Create a descriptive commit message
   - Push to the GitHub repository

5. Document the GitHub workflow:
   - Create documentation for clone, commit, and push procedures
   - Document branch strategy for future development
   - Provide guidance on issue creation and pull requests
