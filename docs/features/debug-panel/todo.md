# Debug Panel Implementation Todo List

## Core Implementation
- [x] Create GameDebugger container component
- [x] Implement TabSystem for navigation
- [x] Develop MetricsPanel component
- [x] Build GameLoopDebugTab for timing metrics
- [x] Add toggle functionality to show/hide panel
- [x] Connect to game loop for performance metrics
