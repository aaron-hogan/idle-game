# [DEPRECATED] Task and Activities System Test Plan

> **DEPRECATED**: This document has been moved to [Task System Test Plan](/docs/features/task-system/task-system-test-plan.md)

This test plan outlines the testing approach for the Anti-Capitalist Idle Game's Task and Activities System. The plan covers various levels of testing from unit tests to integration tests.

## Test Files

We've created the following test files:

1. `EventEmitter.test.ts` - Tests for the event system
2. `GameLoopManager.test.ts` - Tests for the game loop functionality
3. `TaskManager.test.ts` - Tests for the main task manager class
4. `tasksSlice.test.ts` - Tests for the Redux state updates
5. `taskMiddleware.test.ts` - Tests for middleware that handles resource costs/rewards
6. `resourceUtils.test.ts` - Tests for resource utility functions
7. `tasks.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests for the task system

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- **EventEmitter**: Verifies that the event system properly handles event registration, emission, and cleanup
- **GameLoopManager**: Tests the game loop functionality including registering handlers and timing
- **TaskManager**: Tests task initialization, validation, starting/completing/canceling tasks
- **tasksSlice**: Tests Redux state updates for all task actions
- **taskMiddleware**: Tests resource deduction for costs and addition for rewards
- **resourceUtils**: Tests utility functions for resource management

### Integration Tests

- **tasks.integration.test.ts**: Tests the flow between components:
  - TaskManager → Redux Store → Task Middleware → Resource Management
  - Event emissions when tasks start/complete
  - Task progress tracking through the game loop

## Test Coverage Areas

1. **Task Lifecycle Management**
   - Task initialization
   - Starting tasks
   - Updating task progress
   - Completing tasks
   - Canceling tasks
   - Resetting repeatable tasks

2. **Resource Management**
   - Checking resource availability for task costs
   - Deducting resources when starting tasks
   - Adding resources when tasks complete

3. **Task Requirements**
   - Validating task requirements
   - Unlocking tasks when requirements are met
   - Automatic checking of requirements

4. **Event Handling**
   - Event emission for task state changes
   - Event listener management

5. **Game Loop Integration**
   - Task progress updates based on elapsed time
   - Automatic task completion when progress reaches 100%

6. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of missing resources
   - Recovery from invalid states
   - Defensive programming against unexpected inputs

## Key Test Scenarios

1. Starting a task with sufficient resources
2. Attempting to start a task with insufficient resources
3. Completing a task and receiving rewards
4. Canceling an in-progress task
5. Unlocking a task when requirements are met
6. Progress tracking for in-progress tasks
7. Task reset for repeatable tasks
8. Event emission for task state changes

## Testing Challenges

During implementation, we faced several challenges:

1. **Type Compatibility**: Ensuring test mocks match the actual interfaces
2. **Redux Integration**: Testing middleware and state updates
3. **Singleton Testing**: Properly resetting singletons between tests
4. **Asynchronous Testing**: Testing tasks that progress over time
5. **Event Testing**: Verifying event emissions and handlers

## Future Test Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive integration tests
2. Add UI component tests for task display
3. Add performance tests for large numbers of tasks
4. Add end-to-end tests for complete user workflows

## Running the Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

To run specific test files:
```bash
npm test -- utils/EventEmitter.test.ts
npm test -- managers/GameLoopManager.test.ts
```

## Build Verification

As part of the testing process, always verify that the application still compiles successfully:

```bash
# Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run typecheck

# Build the application
npm run build
```

If you encounter TypeScript errors during the build process:

1. Check if errors are in the files you modified
2. Address type issues in your changes first
3. For errors in deprecated or unrelated files, document them in your PR

### Common Build Issues

1. **Type compatibility errors**: Ensure proper type assertions and interfaces
2. **Missing properties**: Verify correct property names in state objects
3. **Module resolution errors**: Check import paths and module names
4. **Type assertions**: Use proper type assertions with intermediate `unknown` casts when necessary

Always fix type errors in your own code before submitting a PR, even if there are existing type errors in other parts of the codebase.
