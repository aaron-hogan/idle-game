# CLAUDE.md Update Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan for streamlining CLAUDE.md and moving detailed process documentation into dedicated files in the processes folder.

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Create Initial Instruction Library ✅ COMPLETED

1. Extracted detailed process documentation from CLAUDE.md into dedicated files:
   - `/docs/processes/code-quality/code-style-guide.md`
   - `/docs/processes/code-quality/architecture-guidelines.md`
   - `/docs/processes/code-quality/testing-standards.md`
   - `/docs/processes/documentation/documentation-standards.md`
   - `/docs/processes/git/git-workflow.md`
2. Created instruction library index at `/docs/processes/instruction-library-index.md`
3. Updated CLAUDE.md with references to these documents while maintaining key points

### Phase 2: Create Feature Development and CI/CD Documents ✅ COMPLETED

1. Created `/docs/processes/feature-development-process.md` containing the structured process for feature development
2. Created `/docs/processes/ci-cd-pipeline.md` documenting our CI/CD pipeline configuration
3. Updated CLAUDE.md to reference these new documents

### Phase 3: Move Development Setup Information ✅ COMPLETED

1. Created `/docs/guides/development-setup.md` with comprehensive setup instructions and build commands
2. Updated the guides README.md to include the new document
3. Updated CLAUDE.md to reference this document instead of containing build commands

### Phase 4: Complete CLAUDE.md Streamlining ✅ COMPLETED

1. Verified that all information previously in CLAUDE.md exists in dedicated documentation
2. Created a significantly streamlined version of CLAUDE.md that:
   - Provides a high-level overview
   - Links to all relevant documentation
   - Serves as an entry point for developers
3. Updated README.md to include more references to documentation
4. Verified all links work correctly

## Final Structure

CLAUDE.md now serves as a concise entry point with links to:

1. **Instruction Library Index**: Central navigation for all process documentation
2. **Getting Started Resources**: Links to setup guides and onboarding materials
3. **Key Process Documentation**: Links to detailed process documents
4. **Project Status Resources**: Links to current project status and critical fixes

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to processes now only need to be made in one place
2. **Better Organization**: Documentation is logically grouped by type and purpose
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Each process has a single source of truth
4. **Easier Onboarding**: Clear entry points for new developers
5. **Simplified Updates**: Focused documentation files make updates easier

## Next Steps

Potential improvements to consider after this update:

1. Enhance documentation validation processes
2. Create additional templates for common documentation types
3. Improve cross-referencing between related documents
4. Develop a better system for keeping documentation in sync with code changes
