# Documentation Structure Test Report

## Summary

We've successfully created and tested a documentation validation script that checks if our project documentation follows the standards defined in CLAUDE.md.

## Test Results

The following tests were performed:

1. **Project Structure Validation**
   - ✅ Successfully detects required project folders
   - ✅ Verifies the existence of key documentation files

2. **Folder Naming Conventions**
   - ✅ Confirms all feature folders use kebab-case naming

3. **Required Documentation Files**
   - ✅ Checks for plan.md, feature-name.md, summary.md, and todo.md
   - ✅ Verifies each plan.md includes an implementation prompt

4. **Documentation Content**
   - ✅ Verifies main feature documentation includes required sections
   - ✅ Confirms summary files include implementation details
   - ✅ Validates todo lists contain tasks in the expected format

5. **Error Reporting**
   - ✅ Clearly reports issues with specific files and reasons
   - ✅ Provides a summary count of valid and invalid feature folders
   - ✅ Uses color coding to highlight successes and failures

## Implementation Details

1. **Validation Script (validate-docs.sh)**
   - Bash script with comprehensive checks for all required documentation
   - Color-coded output for better readability
   - Proper error code return for CI/CD integration

2. **Documentation**
   - README-VALIDATION.md explains how to use the validation script
   - Guidance for CI integration included

## Benefits

1. **Consistency Enforcement**
   - Ensures all documentation follows our standardized structure
   - Makes it easier to find and use documentation

2. **Quality Control**
   - Verifies implementation prompts are included in all plan documents
   - Ensures all documentation contains required sections

3. **Automation**
   - Script can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines
   - Provides immediate feedback on documentation quality

## Conclusion

The validation script successfully checks our documentation structure and content. All feature folders now pass the validation checks, confirming they follow our standard document structure. This tool will help maintain documentation quality as the project grows.
