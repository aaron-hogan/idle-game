# Instruction Library Extraction Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to extract embedded instructions from CLAUDE.md into a dedicated instruction library with standalone process documents. This will improve maintainability, discoverability, and reusability of our process documentation.

## Motivation

Currently, our process instructions are embedded directly in CLAUDE.md, making them:
- Difficult to reference individually
- Challenging to update consistently
- Hard to discover for new team members
- Not structured for optimal reuse

By extracting these into standalone documents, we can build a comprehensive instruction library that serves as a single source of truth for our processes.

## Extraction Strategy

1. **Identify Key Sections** to extract from CLAUDE.md:
   - Code style guidelines
   - Testing standards
   - Documentation standards
   - Git workflow processes
   - Architecture guidelines
   - Feature development process

2. **Create Directory Structure** to organize the instruction library:
   ```
   docs/
     processes/
       code-quality/        # Code style, testing, architecture
       documentation/       # Documentation standards and templates
       git/                 # Git workflows and standards
       project/             # Project-level processes
   ```

3. **Document Creation Process**:
   - Extract content from CLAUDE.md
   - Enhance with additional details and examples
   - Format consistently with clear headings
   - Add cross-references between related documents
   - Validate accuracy and completeness

4. **Replace CLAUDE.md Sections** with references to the new documents

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Code Quality Processes
- [ ] Extract code style guide
- [ ] Extract testing standards
- [ ] Extract architecture guidelines

### Phase 2: Documentation Processes
- [ ] Extract documentation standards
- [ ] Extract documentation templates
- [ ] Create documentation verification process

### Phase 3: Git and Project Processes
- [ ] Extract git workflow processes
- [ ] Extract feature development process
- [ ] Create project management documents

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with references to all extracted documents
- [ ] Create central index document for the instruction library
- [ ] Validate all cross-references

## Success Criteria

The extraction will be considered successful when:
1. All process instructions are available as standalone documents
2. CLAUDE.md references these documents instead of containing duplicative content
3. The instruction library is organized in a logical, discoverable structure
4. All documents follow a consistent format and style
5. Cross-references between documents are maintained

## Testing

Before submitting the PR, we will verify:
- All links between documents work correctly
- No critical information was lost during extraction
- Documents are formatted consistently
- The structure is intuitive for navigation

## Impact Assessment

This change will:
- Improve documentation maintainability
- Make processes easier to discover and follow
- Reduce duplication and inconsistency risks
- Provide a foundation for future process documentation

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on one document category at a time
- Commit changes incrementally
- Review each document for completeness before moving to the next
- Maintain cross-references between related documents
