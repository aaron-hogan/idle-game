# Documentation Reorganization Plan

## Issue Summary
Our project documentation has grown organically but now contains redundancies, outdated information, and inconsistencies across various directories. This reorganization plan aims to consolidate and streamline our documentation to improve maintainability and clarity.

## Goals
1. Create a single source of truth for each documentation topic
2. Remove or update outdated documentation
3. Consolidate redundant information
4. Improve navigation between related documentation
5. Standardize documentation structure

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Versioning and Release Documentation Consolidation

#### Current State
Multiple files with overlapping content:
- `/docs/processes/versioning/versioning-and-releases.md`
- `/docs/processes/versioning/streamlined-versioning.md`
- `/docs/processes/releases/release-process.md`
- `/docs/processes/releases/professional-release-process.md`

#### Action Items
1. Create a new consolidated document `/docs/processes/releases/release-process-guide.md`
2. Incorporate the current streamlined approach from `streamlined-versioning.md`
3. Add relevant information from `professional-release-process.md`
4. Mark older files as deprecated with clear references to the new document
5. Update all README files to point to the new consolidated document

### Phase 2: Implementation Plan Clarification

#### Current State
Two files with the same name but different purposes:
- `/docs/processes/planning/implementation-plan.md` (focuses on release process)
- `/docs/specifications/implementation-plan.md` (focuses on game implementation)

#### Action Items
1. Rename `/docs/processes/planning/implementation-plan.md` to `/docs/processes/planning/release-process-implementation.md`
2. Update references to these files in other documentation
3. Ensure README files clearly describe the purpose of each implementation plan

### Phase 3: Testing Documentation Consolidation

#### Current State
Testing information spread across multiple locations:
- `/docs/features/testing/TEST_PLAN.md`
- `/docs/processes/code-quality/testing-standards.md`
- `/docs/processes/testing/test-guidelines.md`
- Various feature-specific test plans

#### Action Items
1. Create a main testing guide at `/docs/processes/testing/testing-guide.md`
2. Move `/docs/features/testing/TEST_PLAN.md` to `/docs/features/task-system/task-system-test-plan.md`
3. Consolidate standards from both existing standards documents
4. Create clear references between the main guide and feature-specific test plans
5. Update README files to reflect the new structure

### Phase 4: README Review and Update

#### Current State
Many directories have minimal README files that don't provide meaningful navigation.

#### Action Items
1. Audit all README files to ensure they:
   - Explain the purpose of the directory
   - List key files with brief descriptions
   - Provide links to related documentation
2. Remove or update placeholder READMEs
3. Standardize README format across directories

## Implementation Timeline
1. Phase 1: Versioning and Release Documentation (Today)
2. Phase 2: Implementation Plan Clarification (Today)
3. Phase 3: Testing Documentation Consolidation (Today)
4. Phase 4: README Review and Update (As time permits)

## Success Criteria
- No redundant information across multiple current documents
- Clear navigation between related documentation
- All documentation is up-to-date with current project practices
- Every directory has a meaningful README file
