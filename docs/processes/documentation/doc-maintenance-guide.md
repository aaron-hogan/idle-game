# Documentation Maintenance Guide

This guide provides best practices for maintaining documentation quality based on lessons learned during our documentation reorganization project.

## Key Documentation Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one authoritative document for each major topic
2. **Clear Deprecation Process**: Mark outdated docs as deprecated with links to current versions
3. **Logical Organization**: Keep feature-specific docs in their feature directories
4. **Consistent Structure**: Use standardized formats for similar document types
5. **Proper Cross-Referencing**: Ensure related documents link to each other

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Monthly Documentation Review

1. **Audit Process Documents**:
   - Check if process documentation matches current practices
   - Update or mark as deprecated when processes change
   - Consolidate similar documents when overlap is found

2. **README Check**:
   - Verify README files accurately list key documents with descriptions
   - Ensure links are not broken
   - Add links to new documents

3. **Deprecation Cleanup**:
   - Remove documents marked as deprecated for more than 3 months
   - Ensure no links point to removed documents

## Documentation Creation Guidelines

### For New Features

When documenting a new feature:

1. Create a directory structure with:
   ```
   /docs/features/feature-name/
   ├── README.md         # Overview and file index
   ├── plan.md           # Initial design plan
   ├── feature-name.md   # Main implementation documentation
   ├── test-plan.md      # Testing approach
   ├── summary.md        # Implementation summary
   └── todo.md           # Ongoing tasks
   ```

2. Update the main features README.md to include the new feature

3. Create proper cross-references from related documentation

### For Process Changes

When documenting a process change:

1. Create a new document with the current process
2. Mark the old document as deprecated with a link to the new one
3. Update all README files that reference the process
4. Check other documents that might reference the process

## Avoiding Common Documentation Problems

1. **Content Duplication**: Before creating new documentation, search for similar content
2. **Outdated References**: When updating a process, search for all references to it
3. **Inconsistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions
4. **Directory Disorganization**: Keep related documents together
5. **Missing Context**: Ensure documents explain their purpose at the top

## Recommendations for Continued Improvement

Based on our recent reorganization:

1. **Documentation Ownership**: Assign an owner for each documentation area
2. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule quarterly documentation reviews
3. **Version Tracking**: Consider adding "Last Updated" dates to critical documents
4. **Documentation Tests**: Create automated tests to check for broken links
5. **Template Use**: Create and enforce templates for common document types

## Documentation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [  ] Document has a clear, descriptive title
- [  ] Purpose is stated at the beginning
- [  ] Content is organized with appropriate headings
- [  ] Related documents are cross-referenced
- [  ] Correct formatting and markdown are used
- [  ] README files are updated if needed
- [  ] Deprecated documents are clearly marked
- [  ] No broken links are introduced

## Conclusion

Following these guidelines will help maintain a high-quality documentation system that remains valuable as the project evolves. Regular maintenance prevents documentation debt and ensures that team members can find accurate information when needed.
