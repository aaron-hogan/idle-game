# Feature Development Process

This document outlines the structured process we follow for feature development to ensure quality and consistency.

## Overview

Our feature development process follows these key steps:

1. **Planning**: Create documentation and plan before development
2. **Implementation**: Follow TDD approach and make regular commits
3. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. **Pull Request**: Follow our PR workflow guidelines
5. **Documentation**: Complete all required documentation
6. **Finalization**: Update project status and wiki if necessary

## Detailed Process

### 1. Planning Phase

Before beginning development:

- Create a dedicated documentation folder at `/docs/features/feature-name/`
- Create a plan document (`plan.md`) including:
  - Feature overview and goals
  - Technical approach and architecture
  - Implementation tasks and timeline
  - Specific implementation prompt

The plan document must be reviewed and approved before starting implementation.

### 2. Implementation Phase

During implementation:

- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach when possible
- Make regular, focused commits with clear messages
- Adhere to the [Code Style Guide](/docs/processes/code-quality/code-style-guide.md)
- Maintain a todo list (`todo.md`) to track progress
- Update plan document if significant changes are needed

### 3. Testing Phase

For comprehensive testing:

- Write unit tests for individual components
- Create integration tests for component interactions
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Document test scenarios in feature documentation
- Run the full test suite regularly during development

### 4. Pull Request Phase

When submitting a PR:

- Follow the [PR Workflow](/docs/processes/pr-workflow.md) guidelines
- Ensure all tests pass
- Address all linting and type checking issues
- Request reviews from appropriate team members
- Make requested changes promptly

### 5. Documentation Phase

Before considering a feature complete:

- Complete the main feature documentation (`feature-name.md`)
- Create a summary document (`summary.md`) outlining what was implemented
- Update the todo list with any remaining tasks
- Validate documentation using the validation script
- Follow all [Documentation Standards](/docs/processes/documentation/documentation-standards.md)

### 6. Finalization Phase

After feature completion:

- Update project status document as needed
- Create or update wiki documentation if appropriate (with approval)
- Address any feedback from documentation review
- Update related documentation if necessary
