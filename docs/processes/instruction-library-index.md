# Instruction Library Index

This document serves as the central index for our instruction library, providing easy navigation to all process documentation and standards.

## Code Quality

Guidelines for maintaining high-quality, consistent code:

- [Code Style Guide](/docs/processes/code-quality/code-style-guide.md) - Standards for code formatting, structure, and organization
- [Architecture Guidelines](/docs/processes/code-quality/architecture-guidelines.md) - Principles and patterns for application architecture
- [Testing Standards](/docs/processes/code-quality/testing-standards.md) - Best practices for writing and maintaining tests

## Documentation

Standards and processes for documentation:

- [Documentation Standards](/docs/processes/documentation/documentation-standards.md) - Guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation
- [Instruction Library Extraction Plan](/docs/processes/documentation/instruction-library-plan.md) - Plan for building the instruction library

## Git and Workflow

Processes for version control and development workflow:

- [Git Workflow](/docs/processes/git/git-workflow.md) - Branch strategy and git best practices
- [PR Workflow](/docs/processes/pr-workflow.md) - Process for creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests
- [Safe Workflow Checklist](/docs/processes/safe-workflow-checklist.md) - Pre-development safety checks

## Project Management

Guidelines for project-level processes:

- [Critical Fixes Log](/docs/project/critical-fixes.md) - Log of critical fixes and lessons learned

## How to Use the Instruction Library

1. **Reference documentation often**: Bookmark this index for quick access
2. **Follow processes consistently**: Apply these guidelines to all work
3. **Contribute improvements**: Submit PRs to enhance the instruction library
4. **Link in PRs**: Reference relevant documentation in pull requests

## Adding New Instructions

To add a new instruction document to the library:

1. Identify the appropriate category for the document
2. Create the document in the corresponding folder using the naming convention: `document-name.md`
3. Use clear, concise language with proper formatting
4. Include examples and code snippets where appropriate
5. Add any necessary cross-references to related documents
6. Update this index to include the new document
7. Submit a PR for review

## Updating Instructions

When updating existing instructions:

1. Create a branch with the naming convention: `docs/update-instruction-name`
2. Make focused, clear changes to improve the document
3. Update any cross-references or related documentation
4. Ensure all links remain valid
5. Submit a PR for review, clearly explaining the changes

By following these instructions and processes, we maintain a high-quality, consistent codebase and streamline collaborative development.
