## Testing Overview

Our project emphasizes test-driven development with comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Unit Tests** - Testing individual functions and components
2. **Integration Tests** - Testing interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Testing complete user flows
4. **Performance Tests** - Testing system performance and efficiency

## Testing Tools

We use the following tools for testing:

- Jest as the primary test runner
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock Service Worker for API mocking
- Custom test utilities for common patterns

## Test Writing Process

When writing tests:

1. Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
2. Ensure adequate coverage of critical paths
3. Test both happy paths and edge cases
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Keep tests independent and isolated

## Test Review Checklist

During test review, verify that:

- Tests actually test the intended functionality
- Tests are independent and don't rely on global state
- Edge cases are covered
- Tests are readable and maintainable
- Tests follow the established patterns and standards

For specific test templates, see the [Templates](templates/) directory.
