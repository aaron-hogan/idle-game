# CI/CD Pipeline

This document outlines our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline configuration and best practices.

## Overview

We use automated CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and consistency. Our pipeline automatically runs checks on all pull requests and pushes to main branches.

## Pipeline Configuration

### GitHub Actions

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions, with workflows defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

Key workflows include:

- **Build**: Compiles the codebase to verify it builds successfully
- **Test**: Runs the full test suite to catch regressions
- **Lint**: Checks code style and formatting compliance
- **Type Check**: Verifies TypeScript typing is correct

### Workflow Triggers

Workflows are triggered by:

- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Direct pushes to `main` or `develop` branches
- Scheduled runs (weekly) to ensure ongoing health checks

## Pipeline Checks

### Linting

- ESLint checks for code style compliance
- Configuration in `eslint.config.js`
- Helps maintain consistent code style across the project

### Type Checking

- TypeScript type checking ensures type safety
- Strict mode is enabled in `tsconfig.json`
- Catches potential type-related bugs before they reach production

### Testing

- Jest runs all unit and integration tests
- Test coverage reports are generated
- Minimum coverage thresholds are enforced

### Build Validation

- Full production build is created
- Verifies that the code can be built without errors
- Ensures the application will deploy correctly

## Pipeline Standards

### Safety Guidelines

- **NEVER** disable security checks or code quality validations
- **ALWAYS** get explicit permission before modifying CI workflows
- **ALWAYS** test workflow changes in a feature branch first
- **NEVER** merge PRs that fail pipeline checks without proper review and approval

### Workflow Maintenance

- Keep dependencies in CI workflows up-to-date
- Review and optimize workflow performance periodically
- Document any special considerations for CI in relevant feature documentation

By maintaining a robust CI/CD pipeline, we ensure consistent code quality and reduce the likelihood of issues reaching production.
