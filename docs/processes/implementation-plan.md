# Professional Release Process Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation of our new professional release process.

## Background

Our previous release process had several limitations:
- Direct pushes to main branch causing permission issues
- Poor separation between feature development and versioning
- Manual version selection leading to potential errors
- Limited release stage for proper review

The new process implements industry-standard GitFlow practices with semantic versioning and automation.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflows
- [x] Configure semantic-release
- [x] Develop helper scripts
- [x] Document the new process

### Phase 2: Process Transition (Week 2)

- [ ] Set up develop branch
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
- [ ] Update GitHub repository settings
- [ ] Add npm scripts to package.json

### Phase 3: Team Enablement (Week 3)

- [ ] Conduct team training session
- [ ] Create quick reference guides
- [ ] Pair program first few implementations
- [ ] Gather initial feedback

### Phase 4: Full Adoption (Week 4)

- [ ] Transition all in-progress work
- [ ] Monitor workflow effectiveness
- [ ] Refine scripts and documentation
- [ ] Address any issues that arise

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Branch Structure

```
main              ----o----------------o-----------------o------>
                      |                |                 |
                      |                |                 |
develop          --o--o----o----o-----o-----o-----o-----o------>
                    |      |    |     |     |     |     |
feature/x      -----o------o----|     |     |     |     |
                                |     |     |     |     |
release/1.0.0                   ------o-----o-----|     |
                                            |     |     |
hotfix/xyz                                  ------o-----|
```

### 2. Required Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` | Automated release workflow |
| `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` | PR and commit validation |
| `.releaserc.json` | semantic-release configuration |
| `scripts/create-release.sh` | Release branch creation |
| `scripts/create-hotfix.sh` | Hotfix branch creation |
| `docs/processes/professional-release-process.md` | Process documentation |

### 3. GitHub Repository Settings

1. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require linear history
   - Include administrators

2. **GitHub Actions Permissions**
   - Repository > Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions
   - Set to "Read and write permissions"

3. **Required Status Checks**
   - Build and test
   - Conventional commit validation
   - CHANGELOG verification

### 4. Migration Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create develop branch from current main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b develop
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

2. **First Release Branch**
   ```bash
   # Once develop is established
   git checkout develop
   ./scripts/create-release.sh
   # Follow prompts for version
   ```

3. **Update CI Pipeline**
   - Update any existing CI/CD to work with new branch structure
   - Ensure tests run on all branch types

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All new features follow the defined branch workflow
2. Releases are automatically versioned with semantic-release
3. CHANGELOG.md is consistently maintained
4. Team members can comfortably follow the process
5. No manual version management is needed
6. Release notes are automatically generated

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

1. Pause new PR merges
2. Diagnose workflow issues
3. Fix configuration or scripts
4. If necessary, temporarily revert to previous process
5. Re-implement with fixes

## Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| Team Lead | Overall process ownership, repository settings |
| Developers | Follow branch naming and commit conventions |
| CI Admin | Configure GitHub Actions, automation |
| Release Manager | Oversee release branching and merges |

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to transitioning to our new professional release process. The phased rollout ensures minimal disruption while improving our versioning reliability, release quality, and process transparency.
