# Merge Plan for Documentation Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for merging the documentation improvements we've made across multiple branches in the correct order to avoid conflicts.

## Branches to Merge

We have four documentation improvement branches that need to be merged:

1. `docs/claude-md-organization` - Reorganized documentation links into proper categories
2. `docs/critical-git-process-emphasis` - Added emphasis on git process requirements
3. `docs/implement-slim-claude-md` - Implemented slim AI-optimized CLAUDE.md
4. `docs/research-analysis` - Created process improvement plans based on research

## Analysis of Changes

- The `docs/claude-md-organization` branch modifies the structure of CLAUDE.md
- The `docs/critical-git-process-emphasis` branch adds warnings to CLAUDE.md
- The `docs/implement-slim-claude-md` branch completely replaces CLAUDE.md with a slim version
- The `docs/research-analysis` branch creates new files and doesn't modify CLAUDE.md

## Merge Strategy

Based on the analysis, here's the suggested merge order:

1. `docs/research-analysis` - This branch doesn't modify CLAUDE.md so it's safe to merge first
2. `docs/claude-md-organization` - Merge the organizational improvements to CLAUDE.md
3. `docs/critical-git-process-emphasis` - Add the git process emphasis to the reorganized CLAUDE.md
4. `docs/implement-slim-claude-md` - Finally, replace with the slim version

## Merge Commands

```bash
# 1. Merge research analysis
git checkout main
git merge docs/research-analysis

# 2. Merge documentation organization
git merge docs/claude-md-organization

# 3. Merge git process emphasis
git merge docs/critical-git-process-emphasis

# 4. Merge slim CLAUDE.md implementation
git merge docs/implement-slim-claude-md
```

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

If conflicts arise during merging:

1. For CLAUDE.md conflicts:
   - When merging `docs/claude-md-organization` and `docs/critical-git-process-emphasis`:
     - Keep both the organization improvements and the git process emphasis
   - When merging `docs/implement-slim-claude-md`:
     - Generally prefer the slim version but ensure critical git warnings are preserved

2. For other file conflicts:
   - Review both versions and combine the changes when possible
   - Preserve newer content when there are direct conflicts

## Post-Merge Verification

After all merges are complete:

1. Verify that CLAUDE.md is properly formatted and contains all critical information
2. Ensure all documentation files are accessible
3. Validate links between documentation files
4. Check that all AI-specific tags are properly implemented

## Next Steps

After successfully merging all branches:

1. Create a PR to merge these changes to the upstream repository
2. Begin implementation of the process improvements identified in the research analysis
3. Follow up with improvements to the slim CLAUDE.md based on usage data
