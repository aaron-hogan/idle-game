# Code Quality Processes

This directory contains documentation on code quality standards, processes, and best practices.

## Key Documents

- [Testing Standards](testing-standards.md) - Standards for writing and maintaining tests
- [Architecture Guidelines](architecture-guidelines.md) - Guidelines for architectural decisions

## Overview

Our code quality processes are designed to ensure maintainable, reliable, and efficient code. These processes include:

1. **Code Standards** - Consistent style and patterns
2. **Testing Requirements** - Comprehensive test coverage
3. **Code Review Process** - Thorough review before merging
4. **Static Analysis** - Automated checks for common issues
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Ensuring code efficiency

## Enforcing Code Quality

Code quality is enforced through:

- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and static analysis
- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest for test coverage
- CI/CD pipeline for automated checks
- Code review checklists

For more information on our CI/CD process, see the [CI/CD Pipeline](/docs/processes/ci/ci-cd-pipeline.md) document.
