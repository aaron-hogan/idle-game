## Issues Identified

1. **Merge Conflict Marker**: A merge conflict marker (`>>>>>>> 913f8f829de658714bbc42cde32fd3bbb51a7e28`) was accidentally committed in `src/components/GameTimer.tsx` on line 4.
2. **Failed CI Checks**: All PRs #107-#114 failed at the build step due to this conflict marker.
3. **Merge Without Verification**: PRs were merged despite failing CI checks.
4. **Process Failure**: PR #115 was initially merged without ensuring CHANGELOG update validation passed.

## Cleanup Actions Taken

1. **Code Fixes**:
   - Removed merge conflict marker from GameTimer.tsx
   - Fixed testUtils.ts TypeScript directive issues
   - Verified build completes successfully

2. **Process Improvements**:
   - Added conflict marker detection to pre-commit hooks
   - Created verification script for conflicted PRs
   - Enhanced PR workflow with comprehensive CI check verification process
   - Updated documentation with detailed instructions for checking CI workflows

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with detailed information about fixes
   - Added the incident as a case study in merge conflict resolution guide
   - Created this cleanup plan document for future reference

## Verification Status

All PRs #107-#114 contained valid and important code changes to fix linting issues and improve type safety. The only issue was the merge conflict marker that has now been removed. The current main branch:

- Builds successfully
- Passes type checking (with expected errors in deprecated files)
- Contains all the intended changes from PRs #107-#114

## Future Prevention

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Detect merge conflict markers before they can be committed
2. **Enhanced PR Workflow**: Verify each CI workflow and job individually
3. **Detailed Verification Process**: Check specific workflow logs for failures
4. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for resolving and verifying merge conflicts

## Lessons Learned

1. Always wait for ALL CI checks to complete before merging
2. Never rely on summary status alone - check each workflow job individually
3. Check workflow logs for specific failures, not just status indicators
4. Use pre-commit hooks to catch issues before they enter the repository
5. Document processes thoroughly with real-world case studies
6. Have a clear plan for recovering from process failures

## Conclusion

The merge conflict issue has been successfully resolved, and we've implemented safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future. No additional cleanup is required for PRs #107-#114 as their intended changes were correct and are now working properly in the main branch.
