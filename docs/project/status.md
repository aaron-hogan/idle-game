# Anti-Capitalist Idle Game - Project Status

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the current project status, recent improvements, and documentation organization.

## Current Status
The Anti-Capitalist Idle Game project is currently in active development. We have completed the foundation setup and have implemented several core gameplay systems. Recent work has focused on core system hardening and implementing a comprehensive debug panel to aid further development.

### Completed Components
1. **Core Foundation**
   - Project setup with React/TypeScript/Redux
   - Build system configuration
   - State management architecture
   - Testing infrastructure

2. **Core Game Systems**
   - Resource generation system
   - Building/structure system
   - Worker assignment system
   - Task and activities system
   - Save/load system

3. **Recent Improvements**
   - **Progression System Fixes** (February 2025):
     - Fixed type safety issues with Resource interface
     - Corrected UI component rendering and memoization
     - Restored progression tracking functionality in the game
     - Re-enabled progression UI component
   
   - **Game Timer Enhancements**:
     - Consistent tick rates for reliable gameplay progression
     - Better handling of browser throttling in background tabs
     - Compensation for missed ticks during low performance
     - Optimized game loop for improved CPU usage
   
   - **Debug Panel Implementation**:
     - Consolidated debugging tools into unified GameDebugger component
     - Tab-based navigation for different debugging features
     - Game loop metrics visualization
     - Real-time state monitoring

### Current Development Focus
We are currently working on:
1. Event system implementation
2. ✅ Game stage and progression system (Core functionality fixed, UI now working)
3. Opposition and resistance mechanics

## Documentation Structure
Our documentation is organized in feature-specific folders in the `/docs` directory:

1. **Game Specifications** (`/docs/game-specs/`)
   - `final-game-specification.md`: Complete game design specification
   - `full-game-specification.md`: Detailed system designs and data models
   - `prompt-plan.md`: Implementation strategy and approach

2. **Event System** (`/docs/event-system/`)
   - `event-system.md`: Main documentation of the event system
   - `implementation-plan.md`: Initial implementation plan
   - `implementation-summary.md`: Summary of completed work
   - `todo.md`: Ongoing tasks for the event system

3. **Timer System** (`/docs/timer/`)
   - `architecture.md`: Timer system design and architecture
   - `best-practices.md`: Best practices for using the timer
   - `improvements.md`: Recent improvements to the timer system

4. **Debug Panel** (`/docs/debug-panel/`)
   - `consolidation.md`: Overview of debug panel implementation
   - `details.md`: Detailed component structure and organization

5. **Project Management**
   - `project-status.md`: Overall project status (this document)
   - `project-todo.md`: Global todo list for the project

## Next Steps
1. Complete the implementation of the event system
2. ✅ Fix the game stage and progression system core functionality
3. Update progression system tests to match the fixed implementation
4. Implement opposition and resistance mechanics
5. Continue documentation updates as development progresses
6. Begin implementation of content for early game phase

## Development Approach
We are maintaining our established development principles:
- Test-driven development methodology
- Defensive programming practices
- Singleton manager pattern for system services
- Strong typing throughout the codebase
- Self-healing mechanisms for robust gameplay
- Comprehensive error handling

## Documentation Plan
As development continues, we will:
1. Update specifications with new learnings and implementations
2. Keep implementation plans aligned with current project status
3. Document new systems as they are developed
4. Create developer guides for major components
5. Develop user documentation as we approach alpha testing
