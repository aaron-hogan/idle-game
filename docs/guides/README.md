# Development Guides (Deprecated)

**THIS DIRECTORY IS DEPRECATED**

All process documentation has been moved to appropriate subdirectories under `/docs/processes/`:

- Setup guides → `/docs/processes/setup/`
- Contributing guides → `/docs/processes/contributing/`
- Code standards → `/docs/processes/code-quality/`
- Linting documentation → `/docs/processes/linting/`
- Testing guides → `/docs/processes/testing/`

Please update any bookmarks or links to refer to the new locations.

This directory will be replaced with a new guides structure focused on feature tutorials and explanations rather than process documentation.
