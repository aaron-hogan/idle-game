# Development Guides

This directory contains guides for developers to understand and work with the project. 
These guides are focused on explanations and tutorials, not process documentation.

## Purpose

Unlike the `processes/` directory which contains workflow documentation and standards, this directory is for:

- Feature usage guides
- Technical explanations
- Tutorials for developers
- Concept explanations
- Best practice examples

## Structure

Guides should be organized by topic and follow these guidelines:

- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Include examples where appropriate
- Focus on practical application
- Refer to process documentation where needed
- Use proper markdown formatting

## Related Documentation

For development processes and standards, see the [processes directory](/docs/processes/README.md).
