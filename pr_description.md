# Fix: Replace explicit any types in React component files

## Summary
- Replace `any` types with proper TypeScript types across 200+ component files
- Improve type safety in React components, tests, and utilities
- Part of the ongoing type system improvement initiative (Batch 12)
- Fix React component prop types and event handler types

## Implementation Details
This PR focuses on improving TypeScript types in React components and their tests by:

1. **Component Props**: Replaced generic `any` props with explicit interfaces
2. **Event Handlers**: Added proper type definitions for event callbacks
3. **Style Modules**: Fixed typing in CSS module imports
4. **Test Utils**: Improved typing in test utility functions and test files
5. **React Hooks**: Enhanced typing for hooks, particularly Redux-related hooks

The changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving type safety.

## Test Results
- All tests pass (with 2 pre-existing skipped tests that need deeper refactoring)
- No regressions in functionality
- Components render correctly in development environment
