# Game Timer Best Practices

## Industry Standards for Game Time Management

### Fixed Timestep Pattern
Our design follows the widely-adopted fixed timestep pattern described by Glenn Fiedler in ["Fix Your Timestep"](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/), which is considered an industry standard for game timing. Key elements we've incorporated:

- **Time Accumulation**: Tracking leftover time between frames
- **Fixed Update Rate**: Processing updates at consistent intervals
- **Maximum Frame Time**: Capping to prevent spiral of death
- **Interpolation Options**: Supporting smooth rendering between physics steps

### Browser Game Considerations

For browser-based games, we've incorporated these specific best practices:

- **requestAnimationFrame**: Using the browser's optimized animation timing
- **High-Resolution Timing**: Using performance.now() for microsecond precision
- **Tab Visibility Handling**: Accounting for background tab throttling
- **Time Scale Support**: Allowing speed adjustments without breaking physics

### Idle Game Specific Patterns

For idle games specifically, our design implements these key patterns:

- **Delta-Based Updates**: Resources increase based on elapsed time, not ticks
- **Offline Progression**: Proper calculation of progress while away
- **Time Efficiency**: Applying efficiency factors to offline time
- **Time Capping**: Setting reasonable limits for offline calculations

## Reference Implementations

Our timer architecture matches patterns found in these respected frameworks:

1. **Unity's Time Management**
   - Single Time manager class (similar to our GameTimer)
   - Fixed timestep physics via FixedUpdate (similar to our fixed loop)
   - Time.timeScale for controlling game speed (similar to our timeScale)
   - Time.deltaTime for frame time (similar to our deltaTime)

2. **Unreal Engine's Timing System**
   - World->GetTimeSeconds() (similar to our getTotalGameTime)
   - World->GetDeltaSeconds() (similar to our getElapsedGameTime)
   - FApp::GetDeltaTime() (similar to our deltaTime handling)
   - UGameEngine::Tick() (similar to our GameLoop.gameLoop)

3. **Three.js Clock**
   - Clock.getDelta() (similar to our getElapsedTime)
   - Clock.getElapsedTime() (similar to our getTotalTime)

4. **Popular Idle Game Patterns**
   - Cookie Clicker's delta-based updates
   - Realm Grinder's offline calculation
   - Kittens Game's tickrate management

## Areas of Improvement in Our Implementation

Our design improves on typical implementations by:

1. **Clear Interface Boundaries**: Separating timer providers from consumers
2. **Central Authority**: Single source of truth for time
3. **Consistent Units**: Using seconds throughout the codebase
4. **Explicit Scaling**: Applying time scale once, at a single point
5. **Debug Support**: Built-in tools for monitoring time flow

## Potential Enhancements

To further align with industry best practices, we could consider:

1. **Time Smoothing**: Add optional smoothing for deltaTime to reduce spikes
2. **Time Service Locator**: Implement service locator pattern for time access
3. **Time Events**: Add event system for time-related events (day/night, etc.)
4. **Web Worker Timing**: Offload time calculations to separate thread
5. **Resumable Time**: Support serializing/deserializing time state

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on industry standards, our implementation should:

1. Keep GameTimer as simple as possible with clear responsibilities
2. Ensure GameLoop handles fixed timestep logic properly
3. Apply time scale consistently in a single location
4. Use performance.now() exclusively for precision
5. Properly handle tab visibility changes via Page Visibility API
6. Include thorough time-related tests with mocked timing functions
7. Provide easy-to-use debug tools for monitoring time behavior
