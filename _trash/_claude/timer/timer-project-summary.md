# Timer System Fix Project Summary

## Background
The game has been experiencing timing issues where game time runs approximately 4.6-5.1x faster than real time, instead of the expected 1:1 ratio. This creates inconsistent gameplay and resource generation.

## Root Cause Analysis
After extensive code review, we identified several contributing factors:

1. **Multiple Timer Implementations**: The codebase has three separate game loop implementations, creating confusion about which should be authoritative.

2. **Inconsistent Time Scaling**: GameManager calculates scaled time but doesn't apply it consistently to game systems.

3. **Mixed Time Units**: The codebase mixes milliseconds and seconds in different components, potentially leading to conversion errors.

4. **Multiple Time Sources**: Some code uses Date.now() while other parts use performance.now(), creating potential inconsistencies.

5. **Time Update Duplication**: Potential multiple paths for time updates through core loop and direct resource ticking.

## Solution Strategy

Our approach follows industry best practices from game engines like Unity and Unreal, adapted for the web environment:

### 1. Architecture Simplification
- Make GameTimer the single authoritative source of time
- Implement proper fixed timestep pattern in GameLoop
- Centralize time distribution through GameManager 
- Disable all alternative time update paths

### 2. Time Flow Standardization
- Use performance.now() exclusively for precision timing
- Standardize on seconds as the unit for all time values
- Apply time scaling at a single point
- Clearly separate real time from game time

### 3. Browser-Specific Improvements
- Add tab visibility handling for browser focus changes
- Implement maximum frame time caps to prevent "spiral of death"
- Add safeguards for timer drift and system clock changes

### 4. Debugging Improvements
- Create detailed time debugging panel
- Implement precise time ratio measurement
- Add comprehensive time-related tests

## Technical Documents Created

1. **Timer Assessment**: Detailed analysis of current implementation and issues
2. **Timer Architecture**: Design of simplified timer system following best practices
3. **Timer API Guide**: Documentation for how game systems should consume time
4. **Browser Timing Challenges**: Overview of web-specific timing issues and solutions
5. **Timer Best Practices**: Comparison with industry standards in game development
6. **Implementation Strategy**: Step-by-step plan for implementing the solution

## Expected Results

Upon implementation, the game will:
- Maintain a precise 1:1 ratio between real time and game time
- Handle browser focus changes gracefully
- Support time scaling through a controlled interface
- Provide better debugging tools for time-related issues
- Follow industry best practices for game timing

## Next Steps

Implementation will follow a phased approach:
1. Core timer system (GameTimer)
2. Fixed timestep loop (GameLoop)
3. Game manager integration (GameManager)
4. System updates (ResourceManager etc.)
5. Legacy system disabling
6. Testing and verification

This systematic approach ensures we address the fundamental issues while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
