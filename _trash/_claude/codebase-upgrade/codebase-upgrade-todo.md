## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 - Quick Wins (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Focus on implementing singleton pattern for managers
- ✅ Add basic validation to Redux reducers
- ✅ Create central error logging
- ✅ Fix the most critical type safety issues

### Phase 2 - Core Improvements (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implement comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Add state validation middleware
- ✅ Refactor resource state organization
- ✅ Create null objects for core entities

### Phase 3 - System Hardening (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Implement self-healing mechanisms
- ⏳ Add comprehensive testing for edge cases
- ✅ Improve game loop reliability
- ✅ Enhance save/load validation

### Phase 4 - Future Improvements (PLANNED)
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Complete documentation
- ⏳ Final code quality improvements

Remember: The goal is prevention rather than reaction. Focus on defensive programming techniques that anticipate and prevent issues before they occur.
