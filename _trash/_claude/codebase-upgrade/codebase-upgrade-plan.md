# Codebase Upgrade Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to improve the codebase using a defensive "negative space" approach, focusing on preventing issues rather than merely reacting to them. The goal is to create a more robust, maintainable, and error-resistant game architecture.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Foundation

### Step 1: Audit Current Issues (Week 1)
- Complete a comprehensive audit of existing code issues
- Identify patterns of redundancy, error-prone areas, and architectural weaknesses
- Categorize issues by severity and impact
- Document findings in a shared issue tracker

### Step 2: Establish Core Defensive Patterns (Week 1-2)
- Create utility functions for common defensive patterns:
  - Input validation
  - Type guards
  - Invariant assertions
  - Null object implementations
- Develop a consistent error handling strategy
- Implement a central logging and monitoring system

### Step 3: Define Architectural Improvements (Week 2)
- Design improved manager class pattern with dependency injection
- Create factory methods for complex object creation
- Establish singleton patterns for system-wide services
- Design improved state validation middleware

## Phase 2: Implementation

### Step 4: Redux and State Management Improvements (Week 3)
- Refactor Redux actions to eliminate redundancy
- Implement memoization for expensive selectors
- Reorganize resource state with proper categorization
- Add state integrity validation middleware
- Update action creators to use defensive patterns

### Step 5: System Classes Refactoring (Week 4)
- Convert manager classes to use factory pattern or singleton pattern
- Implement proper error handling in all system methods
- Decouple systems from direct Redux dependencies
- Add comprehensive validation to all manager methods
- Implement the null object pattern for system entities

### Step 6: UI Component Hardening (Week 5)
- Add error boundaries at strategic component levels
- Implement recovery mechanisms for UI failures
- Ensure all components properly handle null/undefined props
- Add data validation at component prop boundaries
- Implement fallback UI for data loading states

### Step 7: Game Logic Improvements (Week 6)
- Refactor core game loop with improved timing and error recovery
- Implement self-healing mechanisms for game state
- Add comprehensive logging for game events
- Improve serialization and deserialization of save data
- Add integrity checks for loaded save data

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

### Step 8: Expanded Test Coverage (Week 7)
- Develop property-based testing for core systems
- Add edge case tests for all defensive mechanisms
- Implement integration tests for recovery scenarios
- Create stress tests to validate system stability
- Add performance regression tests

### Step 9: Continuous Monitoring (Week 8)
- Implement telemetry for core game metrics
- Add anomaly detection for unexpected state changes
- Create dashboards for monitoring game stability
- Develop automated alerts for critical issues
- Implement debug mode for detailed diagnostics

## Phase 4: Polish and Documentation

### Step 10: Final Refactoring and Documentation (Week 9-10)
- Address any remaining code smells or technical debt
- Complete inline documentation for all defensive patterns
- Update architectural documentation with new patterns
- Create developer guidelines for defensive programming
- Conduct final code review and quality assessment

## Success Criteria

- All identified critical and high-priority issues addressed
- Comprehensive test coverage for defensive mechanisms
- No silent failures in any system component
- Clear error reporting for all exceptional conditions
- Consistent implementation of defensive patterns throughout the codebase
- Improved state consistency and error recovery
- Self-healing capabilities for common failure modes
