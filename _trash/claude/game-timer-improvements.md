# Game Timer Improvements

## Overview
We improved the core game timing system to ensure more consistent and accurate gameplay progression. The changes focus on making the game update loop more reliable and providing better debugging capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Timer Consistency
- Improved the game loop to maintain consistent tick rates
- Implemented better handling of browser throttling in background tabs
- Added proper compensation for missed ticks when the game runs slowly

### 2. Enhanced Timer Metrics
- Added more detailed timing metrics for debugging
- Implemented tracking of:
  - Current tick rate
  - Target tick rate
  - Frame time
  - Tick duration
  - Missed ticks

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders of game components
- Optimized the main game loop for better CPU usage
- Improved timing calculations to be more accurate

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
- **GameTimer**: Core timing system that drives the game loop
- **useGameTime**: Hook that provides timing data to components
- **GameLoopDebugTab**: UI component for monitoring timer performance

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Current TPS**: Actual ticks per second being achieved
- **Target TPS**: Desired ticks per second
- **Frame Time**: Time taken to render a frame
- **Tick Duration**: Time taken to process game logic per tick
- **Tick Variance**: Consistency of tick timing
- **Missed Ticks**: Number of ticks skipped due to performance issues

## Benefits
- More consistent gameplay progression
- Better performance on various devices
- Easier debugging of timing-related issues
- Improved offline progression calculations
- More accurate game simulation

## Future Improvements
- Implement user-configurable tick rates
- Add advanced performance profiling
- Create a time acceleration feature for testing
- Improve offline progress calculations further
