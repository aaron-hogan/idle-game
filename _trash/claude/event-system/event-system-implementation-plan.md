# Anti-Capitalist Idle Game: Event System Implementation Plan

## Plan

The Event System will add dynamic gameplay events that occur based on player actions, time passing, and game state changes. This will create narrative depth and strategic decision points for players. The system follows our established architecture patterns (singleton managers, React/Redux, TypeScript) and will integrate with existing game systems.

## Task-Track

### 1. Create Event Data Models
- [ ] Define `Event` interface with proper typing for all properties
  - ID, title, description, options, consequences, status
- [ ] Create `EventCategory` enum for different types of events
  - OPPORTUNITY, CRISIS, RANDOM, STORY
- [ ] Define `EventType` enum for specific event functionality  
- [ ] Create `EventStatus` enum to track event state
  - PENDING, ACTIVE, RESOLVED, EXPIRED
- [ ] Define `EventOption` interface for player choices
- [ ] Create `EventRequirement` interface for triggering conditions
- [ ] Implement `EventTrigger` interface for activation logic

### 2. Implement EventManager Service
- [ ] Create singleton service with proper getInstance() method
- [ ] Implement tracking of potential events with validation
- [ ] Add event triggering based on conditions/random chance
- [ ] Develop active event management with state validation
- [ ] Implement event resolution with proper error recovery
- [ ] Add factory methods for creating event instances
- [ ] Create self-healing for inconsistent event states
- [ ] Implement registration with GameLoop for periodic checks
- [ ] Add coordination with other managers for event interaction

### 3. Create Redux Slice for Events
- [ ] Define properly typed state structure
- [ ] Create action creators with validation
- [ ] Implement reducers with error handling
- [ ] Add memoized selectors for derived event data
- [ ] Implement state validation middleware

### 4. Define Initial Events
- [ ] Corporate Media Smear (CRISIS category)
- [ ] Spontaneous Strike (OPPORTUNITY category)
- [ ] Community Support Rally (OPPORTUNITY category)
- [ ] Police Harassment (CRISIS category)
- [ ] Milestone Events for game progression

### 5. Build Event UI Components
- [ ] Create event notification system
- [ ] Implement event modal with:
  - Event title and description
  - Options for player response
  - Consequences preview
- [ ] Add event history log
- [ ] Implement error boundaries for all components

### 6. Integrate with Game Systems
- [ ] Connect with game loop for periodic event checks
- [ ] Implement resource impacts from events
- [ ] Add building interactions with events
- [ ] Create worker/task interactions with events
- [ ] Implement progression impacts from events

### 7. Write Comprehensive Tests
- [ ] Create event singleton initialization tests
- [ ] Implement event triggering condition tests
- [ ] Add option validation with boundary tests
- [ ] Write consequence application tests 
- [ ] Create event queue management tests
- [ ] Implement integration tests with other systems

## Documentation

The Event System will be a core gameplay feature that adds dynamism and strategic decision-making to the game. It follows our established architecture patterns with comprehensive error handling and defensive programming.

Key design considerations:
- Events should feel meaningful and have clear strategic implications
- The system should scale in difficulty with game progression
- Events should connect to the game's anti-capitalist themes
- UI should clearly communicate choices and consequences
- Error handling should prevent any game-breaking issues

Technical architecture:
- EventManager singleton handling the core logic
- Redux slice for state management
- React components for UI presentation
- Comprehensive TypeScript typing throughout

This system serves as the foundation for future narrative elements and will be expanded with more event types as development continues.
