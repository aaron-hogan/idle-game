# Debug Panel Consolidation

## Overview
We consolidated multiple debug tools and displays into a unified GameDebugger component to improve the development workflow and reduce debugging clutter. The GameDebugger provides a central interface for all debugging functionality.

## Key Components

### 1. GameDebugger
- Main debugging container component
- Located in `/src/debug/GameDebugger.tsx`
- Toggleable interface in the bottom-right corner
- Uses tab-based navigation to organize different debugging features

### 2. Tab System
- Located in `/src/debug/components/TabSystem.tsx`
- Provides navigation between different debugging views
- Allows for modular addition of new debugging tabs

### 3. Game Loop Debug Tab
- Located in `/src/debug/tabs/GameLoopDebugTab.tsx`
- Displays game timing metrics
- Replaces the old TickRateTest and TickRateChecker components

### 4. Metrics Panel
- Located in `/src/debug/components/MetricsPanel.tsx`
- Generic component for displaying key-value metrics
- Used across multiple debug tabs for consistent visualization

## Changes Made

1. **Deprecated Components**
   - Moved `/src/debug/TickRateTest.tsx` to `/src/debug/deprecated/TickRateTest.tsx`
   - Moved `/src/debug/TickRateChecker.tsx` to `/src/debug/deprecated/TickRateChecker.tsx`

2. **App.tsx Updates**
   - Removed the conditional rendering of `TickRateTest` in development mode
   - Added the new `GameDebugger` component

3. **New Functionality**
   - Added ability to toggle the debug panel visibility
   - Implemented tab-based navigation for different debugging tools
   - Consolidated game timing metrics into a dedicated tab

## Benefits
- Cleaner UI during development
- More organized debugging tools
- Easily extensible framework for future debugging needs
- Reduced code duplication
- Better separation of concerns between game logic and debugging tools

## Future Improvements
- Add additional tabs for different subsystems (state, resources, buildings, etc.)
- Implement performance monitoring tools
- Add the ability to modify game state through the debug panel
- Create visualization tools for game systems
