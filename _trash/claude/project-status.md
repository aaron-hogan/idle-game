# Anti-Capitalist Idle Game - Project Status

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the current project status, recent improvements, and documentation organization.

## Current Status
The Anti-Capitalist Idle Game project is currently in active development. We have completed the foundation setup and have implemented several core gameplay systems. Recent work has focused on core system hardening and implementing a comprehensive debug panel to aid further development.

### Completed Components
1. **Core Foundation**
   - Project setup with React/TypeScript/Redux
   - Build system configuration
   - State management architecture
   - Testing infrastructure

2. **Core Game Systems**
   - Resource generation system
   - Building/structure system
   - Worker assignment system
   - Task and activities system
   - Save/load system

3. **Recent Improvements**
   - **Game Timer Enhancements**:
     - Consistent tick rates for reliable gameplay progression
     - Better handling of browser throttling in background tabs
     - Compensation for missed ticks during low performance
     - Optimized game loop for improved CPU usage
   
   - **Debug Panel Implementation**:
     - Consolidated debugging tools into unified GameDebugger component
     - Tab-based navigation for different debugging features
     - Game loop metrics visualization
     - Real-time state monitoring

### Current Development Focus
We are currently working on:
1. Event system implementation
2. Game stage and progression system
3. Opposition and resistance mechanics

## Documentation Structure
Our documentation is organized as follows:

1. **final-game-specification.md**
   - Complete game design specification
   - Updated to version 1.1 to include recent improvements
   - Contains detailed data models, architectural choices, and system designs

2. **prompt-plan.md**
   - Implementation strategy and approach
   - Summary of completed work
   - Detailed implementation steps for upcoming systems
   - Development principles and methodology

3. **todo.md**
   - Structured checklist of completed and upcoming tasks
   - Organized by system and development phase
   - Tracks technical debt and documentation needs

4. **game-timer-improvements.md**
   - Details of the timing system enhancements
   - Implementation details and benefits
   - Future improvements for the timing system

5. **debug-panel-consolidation.md**
   - Overview of the debug panel implementation
   - Component structure and organization
   - Benefits and future expansion plans

## Next Steps
1. Complete the implementation of the event system
2. Develop the game stage and progression system
3. Implement opposition and resistance mechanics
4. Continue documentation updates as development progresses
5. Begin implementation of content for early game phase

## Development Approach
We are maintaining our established development principles:
- Test-driven development methodology
- Defensive programming practices
- Singleton manager pattern for system services
- Strong typing throughout the codebase
- Self-healing mechanisms for robust gameplay
- Comprehensive error handling

## Documentation Plan
As development continues, we will:
1. Update specifications with new learnings and implementations
2. Keep implementation plans aligned with current project status
3. Document new systems as they are developed
4. Create developer guides for major components
5. Develop user documentation as we approach alpha testing
