## ⚠️ Required Validation Checklist ⚠️

### Build-Time Validation

- [ ] All user flows function correctly
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

### Documentation and Quality
- [ ] Documentation is updated as needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated with changes
- [ ] For PRs to main: Changes are properly versioned using `./scripts/bump-version.sh X.Y.Z`
- [ ] package.json version matches CHANGELOG.md version
- [ ] No debug/console logs in production code
- [ ] Branch is updated with main

## Screenshots/Recordings

## Additional Notes

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL PROCESS LESSON**: TypeScript compilation alone is insufficient validation. Actual runtime testing with no console errors is REQUIRED before a PR is considered ready for review.
